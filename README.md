# unit-4-game
// In this homework, I had to make a circle game where if you click one of the circles then it will randomly choose a number from 1 - 12. And there is a computer total score that you are trying to get it right using 4 different circles. So you have 4 different numbers for each circles. If you get it right then win goes up by 1 if not the loss goes up by 1. Then the game resets and you get a new random number to get and all the circles get a random number again.
